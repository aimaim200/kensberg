         <h1 class="title">BENEFITS OF TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT</h2>
         <p>We all know we should be testing our code, but we don’t actually do it. I guess it’s fair to say that most of us put it off because, nine times out of ten, it means learning yet another concept. In this tutorial, I’ll introduce you to a great little framework for testing your JavaScript code with ease.</p>


         <p>Today, we’re going to be learning about the Jasmine BDD testing framework. But we’re stopping here for a detour first, to talk very briefly, about BDD and TDD. If you’re not familiar with these acronyms, they stand for Behaviour-Driven Development and Test-Driven Development. I’m in the middle of learning about what each of these is in practice and how they are different, but here are some of the basic differences:</p>

         <h1 class="title">Six Key Consideration When Migrating to AWS</h2>
       
        <p>Every day, more and more organizations take the plunge and migrate to the Amazon Web Services public cloud. What they leave behind is the cumbersomeness of the traditional data center, but despite the cloud’s benefits in scalability, agility and efficiency, they discover a new set of challenges that need to be overcome.</p>

         <p>Gartner estimates that more than 50 percent of enterprises will have adopted a hybrid cloud approach by 2017. Transitioning from a traditional on-premise IT infrastructures to a public cloud can be daunting, however, and success requires a different mindset and range of skills. This shift can be particularly challenging for traditional enterprises because they have a lot at stake. Here are the five main challenges in moving to the AWS cloud..</p>

        <h1 class="title">DevOps In The cloud</h2>
        <p>Clouds are a vast pool of usable and manageable virtualized means such as development platforms, hardware and services. These assets can be animatedly reconfigured to adjust to a flexible load, which helps in the optimal utilization of resources. Your enterprise breathes through IT—to keep your business moving forward, you must modernize and be more flexible to break the shackles of the orthodox technologies that are holding you back..</p>
        
        <p>The cloud’s pay-as-you-go business model enables enterprises to cut capital spending by leveraging the cloud service. It also offers several benefits required by the enterprise, including lower operating cost, no upfront investment, great scalability and much more.</p>

        <p>To gain the benefit of cloud computing and guard the current investment to the legacy system, companies are keen in migrating their legacy systems to the cloud. The cloud provides a cost-effective corridor to transforming legacy systems to more modern technologies. It offers modern efficient development structures, improved supervision of IT resource supply and demand and enhanced scalability, and it provides access to these assets from almost any part of the world. With this upgraded dexterity, you are able to respond more swiftly to the changes in the market, exploit newer business prospects, surge financial growth and drive innovation.</p>

        <p>However, to benefit from what the cloud could offer, you are required to spend money and time on launching your cloud and migrating data and applications to the newer environment.</p>

        <p>Migrating databases from on-premise machines to the cloud has a few crucial advantages: Cloud elasticity delivers instant flexibility in scaling up or down. And, the cloud model saves money by shifting companies from early heavy capital expenses (CapEx) of on-premise hardware to constant, known operational expenses (OpEx) on cloud facilities and more.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Jenkins Continuous Integration</h2>
        <p>Continuous integration is a concept introduced by Martin Fowler in Extreme Programming development methodology, as one of its twelve practices. The evolved version of CI supposes the existence of four elements .</p>
        <p>CI servers are usually compact and easy to setup, use, and configure, which is integrated with a wide variety of distributed version control systems, testing frameworks and  offers out of the box CI for any Ant, Maven or Gradle  project and Jenkins, which is free and open source, widely-used and well documented, used in combination with a large number of tools and technologies and which has a massive  community that supports it.</p>

    <p>In 1903, my great grandparents came to the United States from Italy. Not only did they bring their recipes for traditional home-style Italian cooking, but they also brought their knowledge of raising olives for the creation of fine  olive oil. Over several decades, they perfected the process that now lies at the heart of <em>Two Trees Extra Virgin Olive Oil</em>. Over 100 years later, I'm very proud to have passed this tradition onto my children and grandchildren, and to continue offering my grandparents' wonderful olive oil to the world.</p>

    <p>With the advent of modern machinery and improved organic farming techniques, <em>Two Trees Olive Oil</em> has continued to raise the bar in extra virgin olive oil production - winning awards year after year for flavor, quality, innovation,  and environmental consciousness. Not to mention, we consider our 3,000 employees worldwide to be part of a large, extended family, and have consistently improved working conditions and  benefits, to ensure their happiness and job satisfaction. We feel fortunate to be able to put 5 percent of the total sales from our olive oil back into employee development programs such as  continued education. In addition, another 5 percent of our olive oil sales goes directly to charitable social, environmental, animal welfare, and human rights causes.</p>

    <p>Our goal for the future is to continue to expand our oil varieties, while adding other delicious and inspired products to our recently developed and wildly successful bread and cracker line. In addition, we constantly strive to be the kind of company my grandparents would expect us to be, by giving back to our families, our people, and the world, because at the end of the day, these are the things that matter most.</p>
